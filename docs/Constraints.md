# Constrained fits

It is possible to impose constraints on the fit parameters or some pre-defined combinations of them that are particularly important in microlensing observations. Let $f(\mathbf{p})$ be a function of the fit parameters. Suppose we want to force $f(\mathbf{p}) = f_0$ with some tolerance $\sigma$. Then the $\chi^2$ function is modified as
